	<p> I live in Uyo, Nigeria. Uyo is a not-so-small town located in the land of promise, Akwa Ibom state. Also, with over 400,000 residents including me, this beautiful city stretches over 140 square miles (362km2).
    Additionally, it boasts of a growing oil industry, a collection station for palm oil and kernels, local trade centres, 1 brewery, a textile mill, a federal university and an airport, among others.

			My favorite sport is football. I play outside with Eric. The first rule looks at how the field is set up.
        In the standard 11-a-side match match, the pitch must be 90 to 120 metres in length and 45 to 90 metres wide, with the touchlines being longer than the goal lines.
        The field of play is made up of white lines all around the pitch and is then split in two by the halfway line down the middle which runs parallel to the goal lines.
        The centre circle (where the game kicks off) is located at the midpoint of this line.
        In each corner of the pitch there is a flag post and these help judge whether a ball has gone out for a corner / goal kick or a throw in.
        At both ends of the pitch is a goal which is placed in the middle of the goal line. In front of both goals is a small goal area and around that is the larger penalty area.
        In this whole area, the goalkeeper can use their hands and pick up the ball
        The penalty spot is also marked in the penalty area and it lies 11 metres from the goal line.
        While all of these lines and areas may sound complicated, after watching a single game of soccer youâ€™ll have clear idea of how the pitch should be set up for a match.
